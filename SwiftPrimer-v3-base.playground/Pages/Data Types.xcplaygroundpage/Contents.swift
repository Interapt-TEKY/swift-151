 # Data Types
 Constants and Variables have different types that are declared or inferred

 ## Inferred vs. Declared Types
If you don't explicitly say what the type is, the compiler will try to guess.  That's inference.
 ```
 let hoursInDay = 24
 let daysIn2016 = 365
 ```
 Note that we aren't telling the compiler that the two constants above are numbers.  So it figures that out on it's own.
 
 ### But you could explicitly say....
*/
//:


//: ### And if you contradict yourself....
//let daysIn2016Wrong: Int = 365.25     // <-- This is wrong, and the compileer complains

 ## Summary of Data Types
 You have seen Double and Int so far...
 ### Common Data Types
 * Int - A whole number without a fractional or decimal component, like 3
 * Double - A decimal number, like 3.14159
 * Bool - Boolean representing true or false
 * String - A sequence of characters
*/

 
/*: 
 ### Less common Data Types
 * Float - Another decimal, but smaller and less precise than Double
 * UInt - Unsigned Int
 * Interger Literals - Different ways of representing integer values
 * Decimal Literals - Different ways of representing decimal values
*/



/*:
 ## Your Turn
 **Try It!** Declare two constants and solve 12 - 4 = ?
 */
// Go!

//: **Try It!** Determine the number of seconds in a day using the following constants
let secInMin: Int
let minInHour: Int
let hoursInDay: Int

// Go!
