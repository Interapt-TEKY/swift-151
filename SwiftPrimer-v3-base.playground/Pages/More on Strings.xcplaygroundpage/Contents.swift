 # More on Strings 
 You'll use strings a lot, so let's dig into more detail
 
 ### String Literals
 Strings that don't change - a fixed sequence of characters*/
 let aStringThatWillNotChange = "All work and no play makes Jeff a dull boy."
//: ### Variable Strings
// The plus operator will concatenate strings


// You can also use the += operator


//: ### String Interpolation
//: Using a string literal to format a string


//: ### Length
//: A string is a collection of individual characters and you can find the length of a string by getting the count of the characters that make up the string

var aLongString = "You will soon love Swift"

//:### Comparing Strings
//: Check for equality using an if statement and an operator

var theSameLongString = "You will soon love Swift"

//// Check to see if two strings are equal using the "==" operator
//if aLongString == theSameLongString {
//    print("The strings are the same")
//} else {
//    print("The strings are not the same")
//}
//
//// Or check the reverse using the "!=" operator
//if aLongString != theSameLongString {
//    print("The strings are not the same")
//} else {
//    print("The strings are the same")
//}

/*:
 ## Your Turn
 **Try It!** Given the following variables, print a string that says "Paintsville, KY" using the '+' operator
 */

var city = "Paintsville"
var state = "KY"

// Go!




//: **Try It!** Print out the number of **characters** in the given string

var theString = "How many characters are in this string?"

// Go!
