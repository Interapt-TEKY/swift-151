# Constants and Variables
A name to that is attached to types of values.  There are two types:
* Constants - Values that can be set, but not changed
* Variables - Names for values that can change
## Constants
Used to name values that don't change.  For example:
 ```
 let hoursInDay = 24
 let daysIn2016 = 365
*/
// How many hours are in 2016?


//: **Try It!** Given the two constants miles and time elapsed, calculate the average miles per hour on the trip.
// Go!

/*: 
 ## Variables
 Used to name values that do change.  For example:
 ```
var leapYear2018 = daysInYear + 1
 */

//: ### Other Variations
//: If you'd like, you can delare several variables or constants in a single line

/*:
 ## Your Turn
 **Try It!** Given two variables x and y, add them together and print the result
*/
var a = 5
var b = 7

// Go!
